This repository contains the datasets and code used in the R Conference 2024. The talk focuses on spatial analysis using R utilized in epidemiology

## Contents
- Datasets: Simulated spatial data, including shapefiles, point data, and other geospatial information used in the workshop exercises.
- Code: R scripts for:
  - Reading and visualizing spatial data
  - Conducting point pattern analysis, including kernel density estimation and spatial clustering
  - Visualizing the results of the analyses
- Documentation: Step-by-step instructions and comments within the scripts to help participants understand the workflow and analyses.

## Talk Overview
The talk is designed for public health professionals and researchers interested in applying spatial analysis techniques to health data. By the end of the workshop, participants will have hands-on experience in handling spatial datasets, understanding point pattern analysis, and using R for geospatial data visualization.
